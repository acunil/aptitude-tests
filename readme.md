# Five projects from Codecademy

## Games of Chance

- **Python**

You will work to write several functions that simulate games of chance. Each one of these functions will use a number of parameters, random number generation, conditionals, and return statements.

## Magic 8-Ball

- **Java**

The Magic 8-Ball is a super popular toy used for fortune-telling or seeking advice, developed in the 1950s!

Write a Magic8.java program that will output a random fortune each time it executes.

## Number Guesser

- **Javascript**

In this project, you’ll write JavaScript functions to power a small guessing game. Your code will run in the browser instead of just the terminal, but you have an output section to help you test your functions and show you if you have syntax errors.

## Pokemon Master

- **Python**

In this project, you will be using Python Classes to create a game system similar to the popular game series Pokémon. If you’re unfamiliar with Pokémon, it is a game where creatures (Pokémon) battle against each other. Every Pokémon has statistics associated with it like health, level, type, and a name. In this project we’ll make several classes that interact with each other so you can create your own Pokémon battles!

## Console Game

- **C\#**

In this project, you’ll write C# methods to create a game in your console. The game engine is provided for you, but it expects you to define four methods. Each one determines how some part of the game will work. You’ll run your code using dotnet run in the console.
